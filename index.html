<p>Marble is an artistic programming language, with goals for accessibility.</p>

<p>This image is of previous version of the language written in JavaScript, but JS couldn't write to files, so I switched to Lua.</p>

<p>This is an image of when the language was written in C+SDL2+OpenGL, but it was not very pretty since I was hand-coding the symbols instead of using FontForge.</p>

<p>Programming languages are cool and all, but we need to move beyond discussions about how code is formatted.  This is why I'm putting spaces in variable names.  This is why spaces and tabs are completely irrelevant concepts in the context of indentation.  Ideally, there would be no formatting discussions necessary, but I am wondering if there will still be over things like whether ranges should be inclusive-inclusive, incluse-exclusive, or whatever.</p>
<p>Another goal is having tags for functions.  I very much like function and operator overloading.  They bring me joy.  Hierarchical tags will serve purposes such as namespaces.  Specificity tags will differentiate between versions of functions which should be identical for expected inputs.  Specificity tags would be the name difference between sorting algorithms, or could mark a function as memory safe, or could mark different types of lists and differentiate between non-resizable arrays and resizable vectors.</p>
<p>Another goal is accessibility for programmers who cannot see or cannot see well.  Since spaces will be in variable names, there should be no problems when voicing identifiers.  The Marble IDE will be self-voiced.  I'm still not sure how to voice all that punctuation, but I will figure it out.</p>
